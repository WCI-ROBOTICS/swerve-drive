# Bill of materials
## Understanding the list
### There are two sections:
* [Electronics](#electronics)
    * The electrical parts (Cortex, battery, motors...)
* [Hardware](#hardware)
    * The hardware (Screws, nuts, metal...)
### Each table is split into 4 parts:
* Quantity
    * The amount of a part required
* Part name
    * The name of the part
* Part #/Kit #
    * The Vex part number where you can find the part - this typically has a link
* Notes
    * Any notes about the part
